# CoinCounter
I made this app when I first started learning about Android and OOP years ago. It was meant to be a coin counter (as the title suggested) for a coin collector who wanted to keep track of how many coins they had. (Don't ask me why, it wasn't even special coins, just regular currency.) It's pretty simplistic and I wish to one day redo this app using the design patterns I've learned about in the meantime and the new technologies that have been developed.
