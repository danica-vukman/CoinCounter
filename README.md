# CoinCounter
I made this app as a practice thingy when I first started learning about Android programming. It was a kind of helper for a psychotic person I knew who obssessively collected coins and apparently wanted to know how many they have at all times. It was a while ago and I decided to put it here for no other reason than having something to remind me to work harder on new, more meaningful and complicated projects. It was a long time ago and making this was a lot of fun and lately I've forgotten how to have fun programming so I guess it's also a reminder that I can still have fun programming, even if I'm not earning livelihood from it.

I haven't opened this project in a long time so it likely won't even compile at this point.
